The agent is deployed in the cloud on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku Website"). Read the repo's [README](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo/ "Heroku Repo") to know more about it.

## Use
The website allows you to consult a scoreboard of user. Each user can earn points by using different applications built into the infrastructure.
Each third-party application has a way to use a gamification to generate points. There is a link for each application in the client side of gamification.
